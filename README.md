# Welcome to My Visa-For-Lisa Project

## Task
* Implement a multi-variable linear regression model on a large and complex data set
* Analyze and evaluate the implications of your model on real-life users
* Analyze and evaluate the risk to the business of the implications, assumptions, and decisions in your model

What to expect: the five stages of your project In this project, you should expect to cover the five major stages of working with data:

1. Data Collecting / Cleaning
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Visualization
4. Machine Learning
5. Communication

## Description
This project is about a bank (Galaxy Bank) whose management wants to explore converting some of its deposit customers 
to become personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). In short, they want to upsell customers to 
purchase more banking products from Galaxy Bank.

The bank has had some previous success in upselling to its deposit clients. Still, unfortunately, not all clients 
offered a loan by Galaxy Bank accept it and become a loan customers. The bank's campaign last year for its customers 
showed a healthy loan acceptance conversion rate of over 9%. This data has encouraged the marketing department to devise 
campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.

The bank wants to predict better and identify who will accept loans offered to potential loan customers. It will help 
make their marketing efforts more effective with higher conversion rates.
